Master’s Degrees

The Master’s degree program at The University of Cambodia is aimed at preparing graduates to be future leaders in a broad range of careers in business, social development, and nonprofit sectors, including teaching, research, and administration. Our Master’s programs build upon Bachelor’s degree programs, and they are best suited to those who strive to be independent and self-motivated individuals. Students have the opportunity for flexibility in choosing courses and independent study opportunities that complement their individual interests. Interdisciplinary coursework introduces a theoretical and policy-oriented knowledge base, and independent study arrangements allow students to discuss academic theories and to work on research projects with individual faculty members. In order to enroll into a Master’s degree program, students must have a Bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. As detailed in Policy on the Structure of Master’s Degree Programs, students must satisfactorily complete a minimum of 54 credit hours, excluding foreign language courses.
